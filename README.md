**Objective**: Develop an AI/ML model using Python libraries to generate high-resolution air quality maps (NO2) from coarse satellite data, addressing cloud-induced data gaps and optimizing model accuracy.

**Challenges**:
1. Handling large satellite datasets with cloud coverage gaps.
2. Selecting and fitting the best ML model for accuracy.
3. Validating with independent, unseen data.

**Usage**: Enhance local-level air quality understanding.

**Users**: Researchers and government agencies.

**Existing Solutions**: Limited to individual components; no comprehensive, proven solution.

**Desired Outcome**: High-resolution NO2 air quality map.
